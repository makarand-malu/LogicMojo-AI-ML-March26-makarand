# MINI PROJECT: Credit Card Fraud Detection + AI Risk Explanation System

## Project Overview
Build an intelligent fraud detection system that not only predicts fraudulent transactions but also explains **WHY** a transaction is flagged as fraudulent. This combines ML predictions with AI explainability.

---

## Problem Statement

**Business Context:**
A bank processes millions of credit card transactions daily. Fraud attempts are increasing, costing the institution millions annually. The current system catches ~80% of frauds but has high false positive rates, frustrating legitimate customers.

**Challenge:**
1. **Detect fraud accurately** - Identify fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall
2. **Minimize false positives** - Avoid blocking legitimate customers
3. **Explain predictions** - When flagging a transaction, the system must explain what features triggered the alert
4. **Handle class imbalance** - Fraud is rare (~0.1% of transactions), creating an imbalanced dataset

**Your Mission:**
Design a fraud detection model that:
- Achieves high recall (catches frauds) and good precision (minimizes false alarms)
- Identifies important features driving fraud predictions
- Provides interpretable explanations for flagged transactions
- Compares multiple ML algorithms to find the best approach

## Dataset Overview

**Source:** Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (UCI)
- **Size:** ~285K transactions
- **Fraud cases:** ~492 (0.17% - highly imbalanced)
- **Features:** 31 columns
  - `Time`: Seconds elapsed since first transaction
  - `Amount`: Transaction amount in currency
  - `V1-V28`: PCA-transformed features (for privacy)
  - `Class`: 0=legitimate, 1=fraud

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**

- Train on entire dataset and test on same data (data leakage)
- Forget to scale features before training (especially for SVM, KNN)
- Ignore class imbalance (models will predict all legitimate)
- Use test data to tune hyperparameters
- Provide no explanations for predictions

✅ **Do:**
- Use precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC for evaluation
- Implement proper train-test-validation splits
- Always scale features
- Handle class imbalance (SMOTE, class_weight, stratified split)
- Use cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
- Explain individual predictions with LIME or feature importance

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with EDA** - Spend time understanding your data first
2. **Establish baseline** - Try simple model (Logistic Regression) first
3. **Use proper metrics** - Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC matter more than accuracy
4. **Visualize everything** - Plots help identify patterns and issues
5. **Document assumptions** - Explain your preprocessing choices
6. **Test edge cases** - What about very high amount transactions?
7. **Iterate and improve** - Don't settle for first model; compare multiple
8. **Explain your model** - Interpretability is as important as accuracy

- Try ensemble methods (Voting, Stacking)
- Perform anomaly detection approach (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
- Build confidence scores for predictions
- Create a simple web interface to explain predictions
- Analyze temporal patterns (fraud patterns by time of day/week)

**Good luck! Remember: A model that works AND explains itself is better than a black box that just predicts!** 🚀
